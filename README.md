# GoT_Character_relevance_evolution

1. Pick your favourite GoT characters (if you haven't seen it ask one of your class mates)

2. Rank the relevance of these 5 characters across the 5 books using the criteria you think fits better this situation. The most relevant of the five characters in book1 should get a score of 5 and the less relevant a score of 1, and the same for the rest of the books.

3.  Chart the relevance evolution of the different characters

4. Try to automate as much as possible, do not do things for each book in separate cells and then manually merge, etc.
